        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>I have always enjoyed the idea of creating my own world, a place where anything I want can be made possible, a place where heroes are formed when dangers arise. For as long as I can remember I've put pen to paper to write down whatever
          wild world I had thought of. However over the years I've noticed that to write any truly captivating story I need to practice. That was around the same time my idea of
          Sisila of Siladia, the story of a young man on a quest to avenge his family and town, came into existance. This story of mine changed shape and form morphing into something broader than I had ever imagined. The town became a and the city
          became a country, and before I knew it I was writing the history and culture of a whole world. And now I am starting my journey, probably for the hundredth time, into my imaginary World. Would you like to come along?

        <h3>Drawing</h3>
        <p>For me, drawing comes hand in hand with writing. I love drawing new characters and giving them a bit more dImention through my art.</p>
